This is an Android Application that allows the user to add, remove, and edit teams that are displayed in a Master-Detail Flow. The user is able to add, edit, remove, and  view teams that have been added to the SQLite database in the backend of the list. 

## List of Teams

After clicking the "List" button on the main page, this will navigate the user to the List of teams being stored in the database. From here, if a team is selected from the list, then the user will be navigated to the detail view of the team that they selected. 

## Add Team

The database is initially empty when the app is launched. Therefore, there will be no items being displayed in the list. To add a team, navigate to the list of teams, and then click on the + icon in the bottom right corner. Once this has been clicked, this will bring the user to the "Add Team" scren. Here, the user can enter the fields prompted, and then when all of the fields and filled out, the team can be added and will then show up in the list of teams.

## Edit Team

When looking at the details of a team, there will be a Floating Action Button that will have a pencil logo on it. This, if clicked, will navigate the user to the "Edit Team" screen. From here, the contents of the item being edited will be diplayed in the text inputs, and will be allowed to be changed. When the submit button is clicked, then the new team will be added to the list with the updated information.

## Delete Team

When looking at the details of a team, there will be a Floating Action Button that will have a trashcan logo on it. This, if clicked, will remove the team both from the database and the list of teams.
